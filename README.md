# BinarySerializer
Binary serialisation and deserialisation in Objective-C with bit-level precision

This tool enables reading and writing of data in a byte stream one bit at a time. Number values (signed and unsigned) can be stored with an arbitrary bit length between 1 and 64. The tool is mainly used for reading custom binary protocols (e.g. CAN bus data frames) and creating short and compressed data packages to be used in URL shortcuts as base64 (e.g. pdg://map/MKCi1WccqpkApPW0LyCOQ0ADgxIDDvyZIIGAISAwCIKiICgUgqIhAAAAAJJl stores a shareable level in the game Pixel Disc Golf 2).
